* Voltage Transformer
    * It converts the supplied electricity by the power supply to higher voltage 
* Magnetron Tube
    * It generates the microwave
    * These waves are reflected within the interior and get absorbed by food, the waves will cause the vibration of water molecules present in food which results in the generation of heat that is responsible for cooking the food
* Wave Guide
    * It is a mettalic sheet that allows the microwaves from the magnetron to cook the food
* Switching Element and Control
    * Invloved in high frequency signal routing through transmission path
* Interlock and Protection 
    * It prevents the escape of microwave energy from the oven cavity when oven door is open.
* Over Heating sensing
    * It senses the temperature and signal the other components.
* Timer
    * Helps to set the start time and end time.
* Turn table controls
    * It controls the movement of turn table
