# SMART DUSTBIN
## Abstract
The main objective of the project is to design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and also eco-friendly. This smart dustbin is built on the microcontroller-based system having ultrasonic sensors on the dustbin. After all hardware and software connection, now Smart Dustbin program will be run. Dustbin lid will when someone comes near at some range than wait for user to put garbage and close it. Seperating fdry and wet waste makes the task of recycling dry non-biodegradable waste easier. It also simplifies the conversion of wet waste like leftover food, used tea leaves, etc. to compost. Hence the bin alerts the user to put only the dry waste by beeping if wet waste is detected. 

## DESCRIPTION
* Ultrasonic sensor: It the measures the distance to an object approching the dustbin
* Servo Motor: It is responsible for opening and closing the lid of the dustbin
* LED: It indicates the level of garbage in the bin
* Power supply: It supplies the appropriate volatge to the controller 
* ADC & DAC: They are responsible in converting the signals according to the requirements.
* Moisture sensor: detects the wet waste
* Buzzer: It Beeps when wet waste is detected and alert the person to not put inside the bin. 

## COMPONENTS
### Ultrasonic sensor

An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity. 
#### It the measures the distance to an object approching the dustbin

### Servo motor

A servomotor (or servo motor) is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.
####  It is responsible for opening and closing the lid of the dustbin

### LED

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
#### It indicates the level of garbage in the bin

### Moisture Sensor

Humidity sensors are electronic devices that measure and report the moisture and air temperature of the surrounding environment where they are deployed 
####  Detects the wet waste

### Buzzer

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short).
#### It Beeps when wet waste is detected and alert the person to not put inside the bin. 

## WORKING
This Smart Dustbin sense the person or object using Ultrasonic Sensor which send the message to Servo Motor using Arduino Uno. When the person Comes closer to Smart Dustbin then the Dustbin Cap will automatically open for your waste and after some time it will automatically Close. It also contains the Moisture sensor, which senses the moisture in waste and it alerts the user by beeping, indicating that the user must not throw the wet waste in dustbin. The ultrasonic sensor is placed beneath the lid, which keeps track of garbage level. Once the waste reaches the limit, the LED glows, indicating the dustbin is full.

## CONTROLLER
### Arduino UNO

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on our computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board â€” we can simply use a USB cable

## SOFTWARES

### Arduino IDE

The Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or Arduino Software (IDE) - contains a text editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. It connects to the Arduino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them.

### SimulIDE
