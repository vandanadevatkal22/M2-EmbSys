# SMART DUSTBIN
## Abstract
The main objective of the project is to design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and also eco-friendly. This smart dustbin is built on the microcontroller-based system having ultrasonic sensors on the dustbin. After all hardware and software connection, now Smart Dustbin program will be run. Dustbin lid will when someone comes near at some range than wait for user to put garbage and close it.

* Ultrasonic sensor: It the measures the distance to an object approching the dustbin
* Servo Motor: It is responsible for opening and closing the lid of the dustbin
* LED: It indicates the level of garbage in the bin
* Power supply: It supplies the appropriate volatge to the controller 
* ADC & DAC: They are responsible in converting the signals according to the requirements.
