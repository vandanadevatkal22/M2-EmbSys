# SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM
# Description 
The project presents the use of correct soil moisture sensors which helps to ease out the pain to monitor and keep records about the changes in soil moisture, Using the microcontroller and moisture sensor. The soil for a certain duration, provides information related to the moisture status of the soil. The microcontroller will collect and process the data received from the Sensors. When a threshold moisture level of the soil is reached, the water will supply accordingly. Here self-irrigation works when the sensed value goes beyond the threshold values set in the program, the pump will be automatically switched ON/OFF by the relay circuit and it is connected to the driver circuit which helps to switch the voltage.This is essential because water must be provided to the plant at a particular time for a good yield. This project is highly use for farmers, Nursery professionals by eradicating traditional or manual method of irrigation system.
